## Function fars_read 

This function check for a filename in input if the file exists. If no returns an error else read the csv file et returns the dataset

```{
@param filename the csv file to read

@return a dataframe from the input file or an error if file does not exit
@export

@examples fars_read("mydir/myfile.csv")
```


## Function make_filename 

This function returns a file name for an inpu string year

```{
@param year the year to insert when calling sprintf to get the filename of the dataset needed

@return a character vector combing the input year in the string accident_%d.csv.bz2 instead of %d to get a filename corresponding to the input year
@export

@examples make_filename(2017)

```


## Function fars_read_years 

This function read for one more many years the accident files and then select months and years

```{
@param years a vector with the years for whcich we want to loop

@return foreach year in the input vector years the months found in the dataframe read with make_filename, a warning message with the invalid year and NULL returned for that invalid year if an error occurs
@export
@importFrom magrittr

@examples fars_read_years(c(2001,2017))

```

## Function fars_summarize_years 

This function read and summarize for on or more years input, the accidents group by year and month

```{
@param years a vector with the years for whcich we want to loop

@return call fars_read_years for the input vector years and for the returned year-month will group by year and call summarize to get summary data related to each
@export

@importFrom magrittr

@examples fars_summarize_years(c(2001,2017))

```

## Function fars_map_state 

This function designs a graphic plot for the year and the state input from dataset read in accident file

```{
@param state.num an input state to filter on the accidents
@param year the input year on which to get the accidents dataset to plot

@return a graphic plot with the accidents related to the inputs year and state, read in the dataset returned by fars_read called with that year and then filtered on the input state
@export

@examples fars_map_state(1,2017)

```
